# AUDIT — 2026-03-29

## Project Goals

Wyrm is described as a **"100% procedurally generated first-person open-world RPG"** built in Go on Ebitengine. Based on README.md and ROADMAP.md, the project makes the following key promises:

1. **Zero External Assets**: Single binary distribution with no image/audio/level files
2. **200 Features**: Target of 200 features across 20 categories (combat, stealth, economy, etc.)
3. **Five Genre Themes**: Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Cyberpunk, Post-Apocalyptic — each reshapes content
4. **ECS Architecture**: Entity-Component-System with 11+ registered systems operational
5. **Multiplayer**: Authoritative server with client-side prediction, 200–5000ms latency tolerance
6. **V-Series Integration**: Import 25+ generators from opd-ai/venture and rendering from opd-ai/violence
7. **Performance**: 60 FPS at 1280×720, 20 Hz server tick, <500 MB RAM
8. **First-Person Rendering**: Raycaster with procedural textures and post-processing

**Target Audience**: Players seeking procedurally generated RPG experiences; developers interested in deterministic PCG.

## Findings

### CRITICAL

- [x] **Server build constraint prevents normal compilation** — `cmd/server/main.go:1` — The server has `//go:build ebitentest` build tag which means `go build ./cmd/server` fails with "build constraints exclude all Go files". This contradicts README instructions. — **Remediation:** Remove or change the build tag on line 1 from `//go:build ebitentest` to `//go:build !noebiten` (to match client) or remove the tag entirely. **Validation:** `go build ./cmd/server && echo "Server builds"`

- [x] **V-Series adapters have 0% test coverage** — `pkg/procgen/adapters/*.go` — 16 adapter files (3,221 LOC, 124 functions) have no test files in standard `go test ./...` runs. Tests exist but require `ebitentest` tag. — **Remediation:** (1) Refactor adapters to not require Ebiten at import time, OR (2) Add CI job: `xvfb-run go test -tags=ebitentest ./pkg/procgen/adapters/...`. **Validation:** `xvfb-run go test -cover ./pkg/procgen/adapters/...` shows 82.4%

- [x] **Raycast package has test files** — `pkg/rendering/raycast/` — Core rendering package now has 75.8% coverage via `raycast_test.go` with tests for `CastRay`, `calculateWallDistance`, texture coordinate calculation. **Validation:** `go test -tags=noebiten -cover ./pkg/rendering/raycast/...` shows 75.8%

### HIGH

- [x] **Feature completion improved from 46% to 60%** — `FEATURES.md` — Increased from 92 to 120 features (60% milestone reached). Key completions: Crafting 100% (10/10), Weather 80% (8/10), NPCs & Social 80% (8/10). Added gossip system, emotional states, seasonal system, day/night cycle, enchanting, disassembly, NPC needs system. **Validation:** `grep -c '\[x\]' FEATURES.md` shows 120

- [x] **Magic numbers: partially reduced** — Multiple files — Added `pkg/audio/music/constants.go` with named constants for frequencies, intervals, note durations, and ADSR envelope values. Updated `pkg/audio/music/adaptive.go` to use named constants. Additional files (`pkg/engine/systems/constants.go`) already have well-documented constants. — **Validation:** Tests pass, code compiles.

- [x] **Low cohesion files detected** — `pkg/network/federation/federation.go` (0.15), `pkg/engine/systems/constants.go` (0.20) — Files contain unrelated functions grouped together. — **Remediation:** Split `federation.go` into `types.go`, `gossip.go`, `transfer.go`. Federation.go now contains only core Federation struct and node management. **Validation:** `go test -race ./pkg/network/federation/...` passes

- [x] **cmd/client has test files** — `cmd/client/main_test.go` — Added tests for `heightToWallType` function with various thresholds and boundary conditions. Extracted pure functions to `util.go` for testability. **Validation:** `go test -tags=noebiten ./cmd/client/...` passes

### MEDIUM

- [x] **Genre terrain differentiation incomplete** — `pkg/procgen/adapters/terrain.go:47-90` — Genre biome distributions defined but visuals were similar across genres due to shared texture generation. — **Remediation:** Added `pkg/rendering/texture/patterns.go` with genre-specific pattern configs (grid for sci-fi/cyberpunk, voronoi for horror, distortion for post-apocalyptic, layered for fantasy) plus saturation/contrast controls. **Validation:** `go test -race ./pkg/rendering/texture/...` passes, TestGenreTexturesAreDifferent confirms visual differentiation

- [ ] **Misplaced functions: 72 detected** — Multiple locations — Functions placed in wrong files reduce discoverability. Examples: `MaxPriceMultiplier` in `constants.go` should be in `economy.go`. — **Remediation:** Move constants to their system files following the placement suggestions from go-stats-generator. **Validation:** Re-run analyzer shows <30 misplaced functions

- [x] **Complex signatures: 28 detected** — `pkg/procgen/adapters/entity.go:GenerateAndSpawnNPCs` (8 params) — Functions with many parameters are error-prone and hard to test. — **Remediation:** Introduced `NPCSpawnConfig` struct to group NPC spawn parameters. Reduced GenerateAndSpawnNPCs from 8 params to 2 (world, config). **Validation:** `go build ./... && xvfb-run -a go test -race ./pkg/procgen/adapters/...` passes

- [ ] **Feature envy methods: 105 detected** — Multiple systems — Methods access other objects' data more than their own, indicating potential design issues. — **Remediation:** Review top offenders; refactor to operate on own data or delegate to appropriate owner. **Validation:** Re-run shows <70 feature envy methods

### LOW

- [x] **BUG annotations in code** — `pkg/network/server.go:255`, `cmd/client/main.go:170` — 2 BUG comments indicating known issues. — **Already resolved:** No BUG comments found in codebase. **Validation:** `grep -rn "// BUG" --include="*.go"` returns 0

- [ ] **Stuttering file names** — `pkg/companion/companion.go`, `pkg/dialog/dialog.go`, etc. — 9 files with package-repeated names (e.g., `dungeon/dungeon.go`). Minor naming convention issue. — **Remediation:** Consider renaming to more specific names (e.g., `dungeon/generator.go`). Low priority. **Validation:** Style preference, optional

- [ ] **Oversized packages** — `pkg/procgen/adapters` (16 files, 172 exports) — Large packages can be hard to navigate. — **Remediation:** Consider grouping by category (e.g., `adapters/entity/`, `adapters/terrain/`). Low priority given coherent purpose. **Validation:** Optional refactor
