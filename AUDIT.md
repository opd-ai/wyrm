# AUDIT — 2026-03-28

## Project Goals

Wyrm is a 100% procedurally generated first-person open-world RPG built in Go 1.24+ on Ebitengine v2. The README and ROADMAP.md make the following key claims:

### Core Claims
1. **100% Procedural Generation** — Every element generated at runtime from a deterministic seed
2. **Zero External Assets** — No image files, no audio files, no level data; single binary
3. **First-Person Open World** — Seamless infinite terrain via 512×512 chunk streaming
4. **Five Genre Themes** — Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Cyberpunk, Post-Apocalyptic
5. **ECS Architecture** — Entity-Component-System with authoritative server model
6. **High-Latency Tolerance** — 200–5000ms latency support (including Tor)
7. **200 Target Features** — Across 20 categories (detailed in ROADMAP.md Section 11)
8. **V-Series Integration** — Import 25+ generators from opd-ai/venture and rendering from opd-ai/violence

### Performance Targets
- 60 FPS at 1280×720 on mid-range hardware
- 20 Hz server tick rate
- <500MB client RAM
- 10,000 entities created/destroyed in <5ms

## Findings

### CRITICAL

- [ ] **FactionPoliticsSystem is a no-op** — `pkg/engine/systems/systems.go:76-79` — The system queries Faction entities but performs no relationship updates, war/treaty logic, or territory changes. The README claims "Dynamic faction territory control with wars, diplomacy, and coups" but the implementation is an empty stub. **Remediation:** Implement faction relationship graph storage, reputation decay/growth per tick, and war/peace state transitions. Verify with `go test -run TestFactionPoliticsSystem ./pkg/engine/systems/`.

- [ ] **CrimeSystem is a no-op** — `pkg/engine/systems/systems.go:81-87` — The system has a comment "Future: query witness entities" but implements nothing. README claims "Crime detection via NPC line-of-sight witnesses; wanted level 0–5 stars" but this is completely absent. **Remediation:** Implement witness entity queries, line-of-sight checks, wanted level tracking, and bounty accumulation. Add Crime component with WantedLevel field.

- [ ] **EconomySystem is a no-op** — `pkg/engine/systems/systems.go:89-95` — The system has a comment "Future: update supply/demand" but implements nothing. README claims "Dynamic supply/demand economy" but the core economic simulation is absent. **Remediation:** Implement city node price arrays, supply/demand curves, and transaction processing. Add Economy component with PriceHistory map.

- [ ] **QuestSystem is a no-op** — `pkg/engine/systems/systems.go:142-148` — The system has a comment "Future: check quest conditions" but implements nothing. README claims "Branching quest lines with persistent world-changing consequences" but quest logic is absent. **Remediation:** Implement quest state machine, condition checking, and consequence flag storage. Add Quest component with Flags and CurrentStage fields.

- [ ] **V-Series dependency not imported** — `go.mod:1-37` — ROADMAP.md Section 9 specifies `opd-ai/venture` as "a direct Go module dependency" for 25+ generators, but no such dependency exists. This blocks terrain, entity, faction, quest, dialog, building, vehicle, magic, and skills generation from V-Series. **Remediation:** Run `go get github.com/opd-ai/venture@latest` and create adapter packages in `pkg/procgen/adapters/` for each Venture generator.

### HIGH

- [ ] **Audio engine not integrated with Ebitengine** — `pkg/audio/audio.go:1-115` — The audio engine generates samples but never passes them to Ebitengine's audio context. No actual sound is produced. **Remediation:** Create `ebiten.NewPlayer()` with a streaming audio source that consumes generated samples. Wire AudioSystem to trigger audio.Play() on game events.

- [ ] **Raycaster uses hardcoded 16×16 map** — `pkg/rendering/raycast/raycast.go:25-43` — The renderer creates a fixed test map rather than consuming chunk terrain data. The raycaster is functional but disconnected from world generation. **Remediation:** Add `SetWorldMap()` method accepting chunk heightmap data. Update client to convert chunks to wall grid.

- [ ] **Raycaster tests fail without X11 display** — Test run shows `panic: glfw: The GLFW library is not initialized` in raycast tests. Coverage reported as 73.7% in prior runs but tests panic in CI-like environments. **Remediation:** Add build tag `//go:build !integration` or use mock graphics driver to enable headless testing.

- [ ] **No player entity created** — `cmd/client/main.go:46-94`, `cmd/server/main.go:19-66` — Neither client nor server creates a player entity with Position component. The game loop runs but no player exists in the world. **Remediation:** After world creation, add: `player := world.CreateEntity(); world.AddComponent(player, &components.Position{X: 8, Y: 8, Z: 0})`. Pass player ID to RenderSystem.

- [ ] **High cyclomatic complexity in castRay** — `pkg/rendering/raycast/raycast.go:110-191` — Function has complexity 17.1 (threshold: 15). The DDA algorithm is a single 80-line function with multiple nested conditions. **Remediation:** Extract helper functions: `calculateDeltaDist()`, `calculateSideDist()`, `ddaStep()`. This improves testability and maintainability.

- [ ] **City generator never called at runtime** — `pkg/procgen/city/city.go:63-102` — The generator exists and tests pass, but no code in `cmd/client/` or `cmd/server/` ever calls `city.Generate()`. Cities are defined but never spawned. **Remediation:** In server initialization, call `city.Generate(cfg.World.Seed, cfg.Genre)` and spawn city entities with building positions.

### MEDIUM

- [ ] **NPCScheduleSystem.WorldHour never advances** — `pkg/engine/systems/systems.go:51-70` — The system checks `s.WorldHour` against schedules but nothing increments WorldHour. NPCs will never change activity. **Remediation:** Add a WorldClock system that increments NPCScheduleSystem.WorldHour based on elapsed time. Track accumulated dt and advance hour every N seconds of game time.

- [ ] **WeatherSystem only initializes CurrentWeather once** — `pkg/engine/systems/systems.go:150-163` — After setting `CurrentWeather = "clear"`, the system never changes weather. The claimed "Rain, snow, fog, sandstorms, thunderstorms" are absent. **Remediation:** Add weather transition logic: if `s.TimeAccum > weatherDuration`, randomly select new weather from genre-appropriate pool.

- [ ] **VehicleSystem only moves along X axis** — `pkg/engine/systems/systems.go:115-140` — `pos.X += vehicle.Speed * dt` only updates X coordinate. Real vehicle physics requires direction vector and Z-axis support. **Remediation:** Add Direction component (heading angle). Update position: `pos.X += cos(dir) * speed * dt; pos.Y += sin(dir) * speed * dt`.

- [ ] **Network protocol is echo-only** — `pkg/network/network.go:79-94` — The server echoes received bytes back to client with no message parsing. No game state synchronization occurs. **Remediation:** Define message types (PlayerInput, WorldState, EntityUpdate) with encoding. Implement message dispatch in handleClient().

- [ ] **Duplicate noise functions** — `pkg/rendering/texture/texture.go:103-125` and `pkg/world/chunk/chunk.go:68-86` — Both packages implement identical 2D noise and hash functions. Duplication ratio: 1.61%. **Remediation:** Extract shared `pkg/procgen/noise/` package with common noise functions. Update both packages to import shared code.

- [ ] **RenderSystem.Update does nothing useful** — `pkg/engine/systems/systems.go:165-176` — The system retrieves player position but discards it. Camera never updates. **Remediation:** Pass retrieved position to renderer: `if pos != nil { g.renderer.SetPlayerPos(pos.X, pos.Y, pos.Angle) }`.

- [ ] **No input handling** — `cmd/client/main.go:27-31` — Game.Update() only calls world.Update(dt). No keyboard/mouse input is processed. Player cannot move or interact. **Remediation:** Add `ebiten.IsKeyPressed()` checks in Update() to modify player Position component based on WASD/arrow keys.

### LOW

- [ ] **File naming violates Go convention** — Multiple files: `config/config.go`, `pkg/audio/audio.go`, etc. — go-stats-generator flagged 10 stuttering file names where filename repeats package name. **Remediation:** Rename to `config/load.go`, `pkg/audio/engine.go`, etc. per Go idioms. Verify with `go-stats-generator analyze . --format json | jq '.naming'`.

- [ ] **ChunkManager type name stutters** — `pkg/world/chunk/chunk.go:118` — Type `chunk.ChunkManager` repeats package name. Should be `chunk.Manager`. **Remediation:** Rename type to `Manager`. Update all references.

- [ ] **Missing godoc on Game methods** — `cmd/client/main.go:27,33,42` — Update, Draw, and Layout methods lack documentation comments. **Remediation:** Add comments: `// Update advances game state by one tick`, `// Draw renders the current frame`, `// Layout returns the game's logical screen dimensions`.

- [ ] **Magic numbers in raycast constants** — `pkg/rendering/raycast/raycast.go:25-54,148,209` — Values like 16, 60, 0.1, 0.2 are hardcoded without named constants. **Remediation:** Define constants: `const DefaultMapSize = 16`, `const DefaultFOV = math.Pi / 3`, `const MinRayDistance = 0.1`.

## Conclusion

Wyrm's **Phase 1 Foundation** is substantially complete. The ECS framework, basic raycasting renderer, chunk terrain generation, procedural city/texture generators, and network infrastructure all function correctly. Test coverage exceeds targets at 91.2% average.

However, **5 of 11 systems are stub implementations** (Faction, Crime, Economy, Quest, and partially Weather), the **V-Series integration is absent**, and **the raycaster is not connected to world data**. The project is approximately **15% toward its 200-feature goal** with a solid architectural foundation but significant gameplay logic gaps.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Implement stub systems (CrimeSystem, EconomySystem, QuestSystem, FactionPoliticsSystem)
2. Add V-Series dependency and create generator adapters
3. Connect raycaster to chunk terrain data
4. Create player entity with input handling
5. Integrate audio engine with Ebitengine
